- 👋 Hi, I’m @TheLumiGuy (Arindam Biswas)
- 👀 I’m interested in the Earth's surface processes and how they shape the landscape.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning the application of luminescence characteristics of sand grains to trace sediments.
- 💞️ I’m looking forward to collaborating on developing new methods of sediment tracing.
